  <h1>Javascript Experience</h1>
  <body>
<!--1 Non-technical could mean writing this as if it was a blog post you would have wanted to read when you first started learning these 
concepts or to a friend who wants a better understanding of what you are learning. You should show examples of code and screenshots to help teach 
others! -->
<p>Javascript is a challenging language that involves math. Or more specifically, giving directions to use math and variables. It's like giving instructions on how to build a cabinet including how to measure and cut the planks of wood.</p>

<!-- 2 An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS. -->
<p>An analogy I would use to describe Javascripts relationship with HTML and CSS, I'd say imagine it like a cake. HTML woukld be the base sponge cake, CSS wold be the buttercream and decorative fruit, and Javascript would be the utensils. Like a piping bag and spatula that controls were to apply the cream nicely to the cake </p>

<!---- 3 Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' 
  (but not those). -->
<p>Control flow is the computer going through code from top to bottom, like the steps of making an omelette. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Crack eggs into the bowl.</li>
    <li>Whisk eggs and add seasoning.</li>
    <li>Heat up frying pan.</li>
    <li>Put oil or butter on the pan and pour in the eggs</li>
    <li>Stirr the eggs in the pan until set</li>
    <li>If you like add filling of choice(cheese, bacon, spinach etc.)</li>
    <li>Gently with a spatula, fold the omellete in half.</li>
    <li>Place on plate.</li>
    <li>Add topping of choice(Tomato sauce, butter, herbs etc.)</li>
    <li>Eat.</li>

</ul>
<p>An example of how Loops work would perhaps be riding a bicicle, the wheels are turning in cirles but keeps going in a certain direction it is turned to.</p>

<!---- 4 Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.-->
<p>DOM is a document of all th html, css and javascript working together </p>
<!----  5   Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.-->
<p>Objects define a variable and are given mesurable information and are accessed using "." or "[]" <p>
<p>Arrays store a list of items in a variable and it is accessed by typing the array with a [*insert number in the list of items*]</p>
<!----   6  Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.-->
<p>Functions are a big chunk of code and it's usefule because they can be commanded to do its job instead of running constantly, it can work in specific areas or times.</p>
