  <h1>Javascript Experience</h1>
  <body>
<!--1 Non-technical could mean writing this as if it was a blog post you would have wanted to read when you first started learning these 
concepts or to a friend who wants a better understanding of what you are learning. You should show examples of code and screenshots to help teach 
others! -->
  <p class="class-style-1">Javascript is a challenging language that involves math. Or more specifically, giving directions to use math and variables. It's like giving instructions on how to build a cabinet including how to measure and cut the planks of wood.</p>
  <p></p>
<!-- 2 An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS. -->
  <p class="class-style-1">An analogy I would use to describe Javascripts relationship with HTML and CSS, I'd say imagine it like a cake. 
  HTML woukld be the base sponge cake, CSS wold be the buttercream and decorative fruit, and Javascript would be the utensils. 
  Like a piping bag and spatula that controls were to apply the cream nicely to the cake </p>

 
<!-- 3 Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those). -->
  <p class="class-style-1">Control flow is the computer going through code from top to bottom, like the steps of making an omelette. </p>
  <ul class="class-style-1">
    <li>Crack eggs into the bowl.</li>
    <li>Whisk eggs and add seasoning.</li>
    <li>Heat up frying pan.</li>
    <li>Put oil or butter on the pan and pour in the eggs</li>
    <li>Stirr the eggs in the pan until set</li>
    <li>If you like add filling of choice(cheese, bacon, spinach etc.)</li>
    <li>Gently with a spatula, fold the omellete in half.</li>
    <li>Place on plate.</li>
    <li>Add topping of choice(Tomato sauce, butter, herbs etc.)</li>
    <li>Eat.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="class-style-1">An example of how Loops work would perhaps be riding a bicicle, the wheels are turning in cirles but keeps going in a certain direction it is turned to.</p>

<!---- 4 Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.-->
  <p class="class-style-1">DOM is a document of all th html and css and working together and they can be accessed and edited using javascript. Like looking through a library and everything is their own section and lined alphabetically, ready to be taken out.</p>
<!----  5   Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.-->
  <p class="class-style-1">Objects define a variable and are given mesurable information and are accessed using "." or "[]" <p>
    <img class="thin-blue-border" src="blog/pictures/objects.png">
  <p class="class-style-1">Arrays store a list of items in a variable and it is accessed by typing the array with a [*insert number in the list of items*]</p>
    <img class="thin-blue-border" src="blog/pictures/arrays.png">
<!----   6  Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.-->
  <p class="class-style-1">Functions are a big chunk of code and it's useful because they can be commanded to do its job instead of running constantly, it can work in specific areas or times.</p>
