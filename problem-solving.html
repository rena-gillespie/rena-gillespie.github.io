    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
   <ul>
    <li>When were you blocked on a simple problem</li>
    <!-- what was the problem? x
    what problem-solving techniques did you use?
    how did you feel throughout the process?
    what did you learn? -->
        <p>I was quite stuck on many problems, I tend to over think a problem when the answer is a lot simpler.</p>
        <p>It was a most of the kata challenges that I was stuck on, but the one that used the concat method was quite a simple answer I struggled to get right</p>
        <p> It was a bit embarrasing how long it took, I read up on the concat method in an earlier exersize and our supervisor gave us a hint </p>

    <li>elegantly solved a problem</li>
        <!-- what was the problem?
    what problem-solving techniques did you use?
    how did you feel throughout the process?
    what did you learn? -->
        <p>The kata challenge with Olympics, I forgot that was just a streach exercise but I remembered some looping methods from a previous exersize that would work with a few of the questions.</p>
        <p>It felt pretty good to get something right after struggling through most of the exercise.</p>
        <P>I learned that I am making some progress, I don't keep track of that often.</P>
    <li>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</li>
        <p>Googling, rubber ducky meothod, and asking coaches for help</p>


    <li>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</li>
        <p>I was reluctant to ask for help during the kata challenge though I eventually did, I was quite stuck but kept trying to bulldoze through because it felt like I Should be able to do it. I wasted hours because of that stubborness</p>
        <p>and when I did ask for help it was quite clear I couldn't do it without it considering how much I was overthinking the tasks. I feel like asking for help more is something Im always trying to get better at, but I do need to be less Stubborn as well.</p>
   </ul>
