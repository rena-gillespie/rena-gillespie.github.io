    <h2>Foundations Reflections</h2>
    <h1>Human Skills</h1>

           <ul>
        <li>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning
</li>
             <p>
                What Ive learnt about me and my ego is it is easily inflatable and easily humbled. I get very happy and proud of myself<br> 
                for completing a task, maybe get a bit carried away and when I hit a block I hit it hard. 
             </p>
       
        <li>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
</li>
            <p>
               It's good to know what other people’s values are and what's important to them, it gives you a good idea of what kind of<br>
               person you’re working with and who they’re working with. 
            </p>
            <p>Empathy is a skill that is learned and helps with relationships with other people and to understand each other in a team.</p>
            <p> 
                Self awareness is valuable to understand your own limits, how you may appear to others. While it could be difficult for <br>
                some people to balance self awareness to self consciousness, it’s always important to be respectful to the people around <br>
                you and the impact you can make to them.
            </p>
        <li>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</li>
            <p>What surprised me is how much more self aware I’ve become while learning Human Skills, while learning neuroplasticity <br>
                I started being a bit more conscious of my own habits and what is making my brain more rigid or flexible.
            </p>

        <li>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
</li>
           <p>A challenging part was writing something personal and required a bit of insight for ourselves, or doing the listening <br>
             and looping challenge. It'd take a lot of time to muster up the courage to ask someone to sit in a voice channel, especially <br>
             someone I'm not familiar with.

           </p>
        
        <li>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
</li>
               <p>
            I think a programming school dedicating time to teach us human skills is to prepare us for working with classmates,<br>
             clients and workers after we graduate.
         </p>
        <li>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
</li>
             
         <p>  I don’t believe it was a waste of time, not only was it a break from coding, we got to learn about ourselves and what’s <br>
            important to us and it was kind of an icebreaker for our classmates. It was also important to learn about how to take care <br>
            of our wellbeing and keep track of it through journaling. If we just worked on coding I’d imagine there’d be students that would have trouble <br>
            interacting with other students during bootcamp or overwork themselves and lead to burnout.
