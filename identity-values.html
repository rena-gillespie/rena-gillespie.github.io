            <p> There was a time my family’s cat, Cosmo, was missing for a day and was hit by a car and had to be taken to the emergency vet. The vet there informed me they needed to take some tests first but we were facing the prospect of either getting him an awfully expensive surgery most likely for his hip and leg or putting him down. I felt strongly about giving him the surgery, I was willing to help pay for the bill no matter what they found, we’ve only had him for a short time and perhaps selfishly I wanted more time with. My dad was hesitant because the vet did not give us a guarantee Cosmo would survive the surgery. No one wanted to put him down but we were not financially able to afford it. 
Couple days later we got the call of the final results for his x-ray tests and by some miracle he didn’t have a single broken bone, the first fracture they found in his leg was already healed from something in the past before he was in our care and his hip was fine. All he had was just a bad bruise and a cut on his tail. He just needed painkillers and two weeks of rest. 
When I look back on that moment, how scared everyone was for his health while waiting for that phone call and how anxious we were on what to decide for Cosmo if the worst were to happen, I also remember the explosive relief that came from the wonderful news he didn’t need any surgery.
We’ve had many disappointments and losses, hoping for the best isn’t always met with good news, but I don’t think wishing for it is pointless or naive. I don’t believe there’s a god listening but holding on to hope with white knuckles, until it hurts, even if it’s foolish, made clear how much I loved this cat and how much I wanted him to stay with us.

</p> I believe my culture taught me to respect and treasure the people in my life no matter how brief, I moved a lot growing up between New Zealand and Japan. 
The people around me taught me many things: kindness, creativity, being true to yourself and treating everyone around you with dignity and respect.</p>
</p> My strengths are in puzzle solving and artistic creativity. I believe puzzle solving will help in general, I make quite a lot of connections in ideas. And my background in art will be useful in aesthetic choices in web design.</p>
  </p>To be honest my shortcomings are that I’m easily distracted and forgetful. I try my best to keep focus though it gets difficult at times. I am also quite shy and socially anxious, this is something I’ve been trying to take steps in improving but it makes it difficult to ask for help or reach out and connect with people in fear I am bothering them.</p>
</p>I used to work as a wait staff at a restaurant a couple months before I applied for Dev Academy, and there were some members of our team who did not get along no matter what. They were both great at their jobs but I suppose they were both the kind of people that will respect you if they are respected first, so that wouldn’t work if both of them were waiting for respect. 
I did my best to be neutral, I was friendly with both these members but did my best to mind my own business and never get involved in any drama between them. When they shared their opinion on what they thought about the other coworker, I kept my mouth shut. I let them air their grievances, I’d try to suggest the other’s perspective but never tell them they’re wrong or try to change their mind because sometimes that just makes them mad. 
I think despite being a people pleaser, I learnt what it means to be “professional” is sometimes understanding that some workplace dramas are just none of your business and the less you’re involved the better. You’re here to clock in and get paid and you can just do your best to keep the ship running smoothly to get the job done. </p>
