    What is your long term goal or career pathway?

    <p>My long term goal is to learn as much as I can about web design and coding.</p>

    A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning

    <p>My strength lies in creativity and and working hard.</p>
    <p>My Limitations on the other hand is being easily distracted and having trouble communicating when I need help.</p>

    What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

    <p>I hope to impove communications with others.</p>

        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
       
    <p>I would like to plan my workload by dividing my time realistically, I will set timers for breaks and will offically write that I will do work for 5 minutes but I end up getting into the groove by then and keep going. </p>

    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way

    <p>I find it difficult to figure out when is a good time to ask for help, usually I would if i'm REALLY stuck but I hope to get a better sense on when to seek assistance.</p>
   
    A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team

    Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

    <ul>
        <li>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</li>
            <p>I hope to expand my skillset and get closer to work in the creative industry.<br> 
            I would like a reliable job while I work towards my goal to work in games or animation <br>
            that isn’t physically taxing like my previous wait staff job, and coding is a skill I was <br>
            interested in learning.
</p>

        <li>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</li>
            <p>I’ve become unsure of what my strengths and weaknesses are. I think I could still design a<br>
             nice layout on paper for a website but I'm still learning how to execute anything. 
</p>

        <li>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</li>
            <p>Probably managing my time, staying focused and motivated for a long period of time. <br>
                I have unmedicated ADHD and it’s always been a struggle to maintain concentration for hours. <br>
                I’m hoping being in a learning environment will help.
</p>

        <li>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
           <p>I hope to improve organisation and communication with others.
</p>

        <li>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li>
            <p>I honestly don’t know what to expect, I hope they’ll have a better idea of what they’re doing than I do!</p>
        
        <li>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</li>
            <p>Though I don’t have a very good track record for keeping up to self made plans or schedules, I hope to stick to a plan as much as I can. My focus can fluctuate so maybe staying to 25min work and 5min break consistently.
