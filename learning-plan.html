    What is your long term goal or career pathway?

    <p>My long term goal is to learn as much as I can about web design and coding.</p>

    A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning

    <p>My strength lies in creativity and and working hard.</p>
    <p>My Limitations on the other hand is being easily distracted and having trouble communicating when I need help.</p>

    What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

    <p>I hope to impove communications with others.</p>

        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
       
    <p>I would like to plan my workload by dividing my time realistically, I will set timers for breaks and will offically write that I will do work for 5 minutes but I end up getting into the groove by then and keep going. </p>

    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way

    <p>I find it difficult to figure out when is a good time to ask for help, usually I would if i'm REALLY stuck but I hope to get a better sense on when to seek assistance.</p>
   
    A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team

    Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
