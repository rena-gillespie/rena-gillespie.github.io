    <h1>Neuroplacticity</h1>
   
    
    <ul>
        <li>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</li>
            <p>
                It brings awareness to how their brain works and perhaps understand how some habits would be bad or good for their brain. 
            </p>

        <li>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</li>
            <p>
                Put more effort into limiting distractions, try to be less frustrated and more curious when I donâ€™t understand something and be patient with myself.    
            </p>
        <li>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?  </li>
            <p>
                When starting a new lesson start small and simple to feel encouraged when you get something right or give yourself a little treat. Engage in a different hobby

    <h1>Research Growth Mindset</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</li>
             <p>
                 Growth mindset is the belief about ourselves and whether we can grow and improve ourselves instead of believing we cannot change.
             </p>
       
        <li>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</li>
            <p>
                What surprised me is seeing how many habits of mine are leaning to the fixed mindset. I hope to be able to change this and train myself to be more of the growth mindset.
            </p>

        <li>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</li>
            <p> 
                Probably by rethinking how I do things, treating myself when I work hard, maybe taking more risks making my blog, and picking up a hobby to do in my down time.

        <li>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</li>
         <p>
            Understanding this has made me a bit more self aware. Maybe it will influence my learning strategy to be a bit more bite sized to get that feeling of achievement.
